    @template aiplacement_competency/framework_select

    Renders the initial “pre-step” screen in the AI classification drawer where the user
    selects a competency framework before running classification.

    The template includes:
    - A heading and helper text (lang strings)
    - A framework <select> element that is expected to be populated by JS
    - Continue / Cancel buttons for progressing or aborting the workflow

    Expected context:
    - No custom context variables are required.
      The framework options are loaded and injected into the <select> by the plugin’s JS.

    JS hooks:
    - #classify-preselect: target <select> to populate and read selected framework id
    - [data-action="continue"]: proceeds to the next step (initially disabled until selection)
    - [data-action="cancel"]: cancels/closes the workflow

    Notes:
    - The “Continue” button starts disabled and should be enabled by JS after a valid framework is selected.
    - This view is typically rendered into the drawer body dynamically as part of the placement workflow.
