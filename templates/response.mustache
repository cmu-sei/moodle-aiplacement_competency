    @template aiplacement_competency/response

    Renders the AI classification result card shown inside the drawer after running the
    placement. It displays the selected framework, the levels used for classification,
    and the list of suggested competencies, along with action buttons.

    The card also includes a copy-to-clipboard target and a watermark indicating AI-generated content.

    Expected context (json):
    {
        "action": "classify_text",
        "heading": "Suggested competencies",
        "uniqid": "abc123",
        "frameworkid": 12,
        "frameworkshortname": "SEI-COMP",
        "usedlevels": ["beginner", "intermediate"],
        "competencies": [
            "C1 - Communicate effectively",
            "C2 - Analyze requirements"
        ]
    }

    Context fields:
    - action (string): name of the action performed (written to data-action-performed)
    - heading (string): title shown at the top of the card
    - uniqid (string): unique suffix used to create a stable DOM id for copy-to-clipboard
    - frameworkid (int|string): framework identifier (written to data-frameworkid)
    - frameworkshortname (string, optional): framework shortname; shows "none" if missing
    - usedlevels (array of string, optional): level names used for classification; shows "none" if empty
    - competencies (array of string, optional): suggested competencies; shows "none" if empty

    JS hooks:
    - [data-action="regenerate"]: reruns the AI classification
    - [data-action="copytoclipboard"] with data-clipboard-target: copies the response block
    - [data-action="applycmps"]: opens the "apply competencies" flow/modal
    - #course-assist-response-content-{{uniqid}}: copy-to-clipboard target container
    - dd[data-frameworkid]: provides selected framework id for subsequent actions
    - dd[data-section="competencies"]: region containing the competency list

    Notes:
    - The competency list items are rendered as plain text (escaped by Mustache).
    - The watermark string comes from core_ai and should remain for transparency.
