    @template aiplacement_competency/drawer

    Renders the side drawer container used by the AI Placement "classify" workflow.
    The drawer provides:
    - A close button (top header)
    - An initially empty body container where plugin JS injects the UI (forms, results, modals, etc.)

    The template also boots the plugin's AMD module to initialize the placement on the page.

    Expected context (json):
    {
        "userid": 123,
        "contextid": 456
    }

    Notes:
    - The drawer body is intentionally empty and is populated dynamically by JS.
    - The body includes `data-cancelled` to allow JS to track whether the workflow was cancelled.
    - The embedded JS requires `aiplacement_competency/placement` and instantiates it with:
        new Cls(userid, contextid)
      where `contextid` is the current page context (course or module context).
    - The close button is expected to be wired up by the AMD module.
