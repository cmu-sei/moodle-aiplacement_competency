{{!
    @template aiplacement_competency/newactivity_notice

    Renders an informational notice shown when the AI placement workflow is not available
    because the user is creating a new activity that has not been saved yet.

    This is typically used to tell the user they must save the activity first (so it has a cmid)
    before competencies can be classified/applied.

    Expected context (json):
    {
        "message": "<p>Save this activity to enable AI classification.</p>"
    }

    Context fields:
    - message (string, HTML): The notice body to display. Rendered as raw HTML via triple-stash.

    Notes:
    - The wrapper includes `data-region="aiplacement-newactivity-notice"` so JS can find, update,
      or hide the notice if the page state changes.
    - Because `{{{ message }}}` renders raw HTML, ensure the message content is generated safely
      server-side (e.g., via Moodle's formatting/escaping helpers) to avoid XSS.
