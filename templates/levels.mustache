    @template aiplacement_competency/levels

    Renders the “level selection” step in the AI classification drawer workflow.
    After a competency framework is chosen, this view lets the user pick one or more
    framework “levels” (taxonomy buckets) to constrain the classification.

    The template includes:
    - A heading and helper text (lang strings)
    - A checkbox list of available levels (options)
    - Continue / Back / Cancel controls

    Expected context (json):
    {
        "options": [
            {
                "value": "levelid_or_key",
                "label": "Level name",
                "help": "Optional helper text shown under the level"
            }
        ]
    }

    Context fields:
    - options (array): list of selectable levels
        - value (string): value for the checkbox (typically an id or key used by JS)
        - label (string): label shown next to the checkbox
        - help (string, optional): small helper text shown under the item

    JS hooks:
    - input[name="classify-levels"]: checkboxes read to determine selected levels
    - [data-action="continue"]: proceeds to the next step (initially disabled)
    - [data-action="back"]: returns to the previous step (framework selection)
    - [data-action="cancel"]: cancels/closes the workflow

    Notes:
    - The “Continue” button starts disabled and should be enabled by JS when at least one
      level is selected (or when the workflow permits continuing without a selection).
    - When no options are provided, an empty-state message is shown.
